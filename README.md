# Positively-Better
Jod's Projects on the path to Coding World

Hello! I'm Joderick. I'm a fourth year mechanical engineering student from Philippines.
I had some coding with Turbo Pascal in high school. From then, I never had any experience
doing coding again. Now I'm 37 years old, and somehow I want to try writing programs again.

It just fascinates me how the whole thing about computer works. Plus I want to start a
mini-school about coding when I do get better at this. I want to open the eyes of people
to great opportunities that I think is in coding.
